    "Description":"The Camp Collins Club was formed in 1885 when eight railroad managers decided to establish a club for family summer vacations and purchased acreage with 1,400 feet of shoreline. As membership increased, the railroad built a small station named \"Lake Kegonsa\" for members to de-train and walk to the camp. The camp even had a golf course. In 1906 the Camp Collins Club dissolved and subdivided the property. Stoughton Country Club. In the late 1880's some of the railroad executives from Chicago that started Camp Collins had an idea about building a golf course. They made an arrangement with a local farmer, Thor Olson to use his meadow. Armed with scythes they cut the long grass and played golf in the stubble. Olson's Meadow would later become the first nine holes of the Stoughton Country Club. It was the only golf course on the Yahara Lakes for years. To the west of the clubhouse along the bluff, early commercial fishermen built a small dam. The cool, spring-fed pond behind the dam provided an excellent live holding \"tank\" for their catch.  ",

    "Name":"Fish Camp",
    "Description":"Fish Camp County Park was a place for carp seining for many years. The State stocked the lake with carp from 1881-1897, and by the 1930s about three quarters to one million pounds of carp per year were removed and sold for food from each of the lower three Yahara Lakes. Lake Waubesa, in particular, had an abundance. The carp were placed in large water tanks on boxcars and sent to Chicago, New York, and southern states where they were sold as a delicacy. Small fish were canned at Nine Springs for animal feed, plowed under for fertilizer, and sold live to mink ranchers. The State ran these operations until 1976, when it transferred the business to the private sector. More recently, commercial fishermen used the area in early spring and late fall for unloading carp caught in gill nets. Now the park offers a canoe launch, public restrooms, accessible piers, walk-in fishing, and a fish cleaning area. The original 1937 storehouses for nets and boats have been restored.",

An excess of 80,000lbs were removed on 5/5/2017 and 5/6/2017. The goal is to remove 200,000lbs per year for five years. Carp affect lake health as they uproot vegetation and disturb sediments. These bottom feeders impede fixation and cause added release of nutrients, like Phosphorus and Nitrogen, that affect the clarity of the lake. The project includes cooperation between FOLKS, Clean Lakes Alliance, and the DNR since 2015.",
